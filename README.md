# BlenderBillboardGenerator
A generator to create billboard textures from an object in blender for unity

## To use
copy paste the script into the scripting tab in blender, then select the object you wish to billboard, make sure it is centered around 0,0,0.
I am using this on trees made from sapling tree addon, but it should work for others.
